# KatTittBot
Bot under development intended for use on Norwegian Bokm√•l Wikipedia (nowiki) to provide various types of lists.

It uses the [mwn framework](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Mwn).

A goal is for it to be able to:
* List new articles within a category           (planned)
* List the most popular articles during a day   (in progress)

Its user page can be found on nowiki [here](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruker:KatTittBot).
